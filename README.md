# Simple Easter Egg

Add a simple confetti style easter egg to any website.

To use, add the contents of this repository to your website, and then add the
following to your `<head>`:

```html
<head>
    <script type="module" src="easteregg.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="easteregg.css" />
</head>
```

By default, the easter egg is activated by typing ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A [space].
